# storybook-simple-example

## About

Just a simple Storybook example. This is me checking out [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is just a button, input and card with a few differing styles.

You can load up the mostly default React app and see a terrible looking button and input was added.

Loading up Storybook shows the same components, but isolated from the rest of the app.

There is a alert card component containing the other two components.

These are in Atomic design organziation.

Editing `components/Atoms/Button/buttonStyle.css` will change the button for the story and the button in `App.js`. This is true for all the components.
