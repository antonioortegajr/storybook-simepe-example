# storybook-simple-example

## About

Just a simple Storybook example. This is me checking out [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). This is just a button with a few differing styles.

You can load up the mostly default React app and see a terrible looking button was added.

Loading up Storybook shows the same button component, but isolated from the rest of the app.

Editing `components/Atoms/Button/buttonStyle.css` will change the button for the story and the button in `App.js`.
